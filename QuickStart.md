# Quick Start #

  1. Download the latest version of JBSim from the [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/botballsim/downloads/list) page. Look for an entry with the "Featured" label for the latest stable version.
  1. Extract the .zip file to any convenient location.
  1. If your system does not have Java installed, download and install it from the [Sun website](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp). You probably want a JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
  1. Double-click on the extracted JAR file to launch the simulator.
