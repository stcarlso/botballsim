= Known Issues =

This is *not* a replacement for the [http://code.google.com/p/botballsim/issues/list issue tracker]. Instead, it serves as a place where known issues can be tracked. New issues filed in the tracker which have not been fixed and are important to users should be placed here. If an issue is fixed in a release version, it should be removed from this list.

  * Clicking the Play button sometimes freezes the simulator. *Workaround:* Restart the program using operating system's "close unresponsive program" feature.

  * Screen resolution required to see the entire screen is quite large.
